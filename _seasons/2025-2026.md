## Robot Overview {#robot}

**Phoenix** is our competition robot for the INTO THE DEEP season. Designed for speed, precision, and reliability, Phoenix combines innovative mechanisms with battle-tested engineering.

### Drivetrain
- **Type:** Mecanum drive for omnidirectional movement
- **Motors:** 4x REV HD Hex Motors (20:1 gearboxes)
- **Wheels:** 100mm REV Mecanum wheels
- **Speed:** 2.1 m/s top speed, optimized for quick cycles
- **Features:** Encoder-based odometry, IMU for heading correction

### Scoring Mechanism
- **Lift:** Dual-stage linear slide system reaching 36" extension
- **Actuator:** Lead screw with position feedback
- **Precision:** ±0.5" repeatability for consistent scoring
- **Speed:** Full extension in 1.8 seconds

### Intake System
- **Design:** Compliant wheel intake with adjustable geometry
- **Collection:** Active roller system with optical sensors
- **Capacity:** Single game element secure hold
- **Cycle Time:** 2.5 seconds from floor to scoring position

### Control System
- **Controller:** REV Control Hub
- **Sensors:** 2x distance sensors, 4x limit switches, IMU, color sensor
- **Vision:** Logitech C920 webcam with OpenCV pipeline
- **Communication:** Dual driver stations with redundant connection

## Autonomous Capabilities {#auto}

Sofia and the programming team have developed three autonomous routines optimized for different alliance strategies:

### Route A: High Score
- Scores 2 preloaded elements in high goal
- Collects 1 additional element
- Parks in observation zone
- **Expected Points:** 35-40

### Route B: Defensive Position
- Scores 1 preloaded element
- Navigates to strategic blocking position
- Parks in alliance zone
- **Expected Points:** 20-25 (plus denial value)

### Route C: Cooperative
- Coordinates with alliance partner
- Focuses on elements partner can't reach
- Maximizes combined scoring
- **Expected Points:** 30-35

**Autonomous success rate in testing:** 94% across 50+ runs

### Code Highlights
```java
// Sample autonomous scoring sequence
public void scoreHighGoal() {
    lift.setPosition(LIFT_HIGH);
    waitForLift();
    intake.release();
    sleep(200);
    lift.setPosition(LIFT_HOME);
}
```

## CAD Files {#cad}

{% if site.features.cad_viewer %}
Phoenix was designed in Onshape with full parametric modeling for easy iteration.

### Design Philosophy
- **Modularity:** Each mechanism can be removed independently
- **Serviceability:** All fasteners accessible without disassembly
- **Weight Distribution:** Low center of gravity for stability

### Key Assemblies

| Assembly | Parts | Weight |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Drivetrain | 47 | 8.2 lbs |
| Lift System | 32 | 3.1 lbs |
| Intake | 18 | 1.4 lbs |
| Electronics | 24 | 2.8 lbs |
| **Total Robot** | **121** | **15.5 lbs** |

*CAD files available to other teams upon request for educational purposes. Contact us!*
