We had an amazing time at League Meet 1 this weekend!

## Results

Our robot performed great, finishing with a 4-1 record in qualifying matches.

### Highlights

- Won the Think Award for our engineering notebook
- Highest autonomous score of the event (45 points)
- Made it to semifinals

## What We Learned

1. Our intake needs faster cycle times
2. Driver practice paid off - much smoother driving than scrimmages
3. Pit organization made repairs quick and easy

## Next Steps

We're already working on improvements for League Meet 2:

- Redesigning the intake rollers
- Adding sensors for automatic alignment
- More driver practice!

Thanks to everyone who came out to support us!

### Adding Your Logo

1. Create or export your team logo as a PNG file (recommended: 200x200 pixels)
2. Go to `assets/images/` in your repository
3. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
4. Upload your logo (e.g., `logo.png`)
5. Update `_config.yml` to point to it:

```yaml
site:
  logo: "/assets/images/logo.png"
```

### Adding Team Photos

1. Go to `assets/images/`
2. Create a folder called `team/` (click "Add file" → "Create new file" → type `team/.gitkeep`)
3. Upload photos to `assets/images/team/`
4. Update `_data/team.yml` to reference them:

```yaml
- name: Sarah Chen

```

**Photo Tips:**
- Square photos work best (e.g., 400x400 pixels)
- Keep file sizes under 500KB for fast loading
- Use JPG for photos, PNG for logos/graphics

## Advanced Features

### 3D Robot Viewer

Display an interactive 3D model of your robot:

1. Export your CAD as GLTF or GLB format
2. Upload to `assets/models/robot.glb`
3. Add to your season page:

```liquid
{% include components/robot-viewer.html
   model_src="/assets/models/robot.glb"
   alt_text="3D model of Phoenix robot"
%}
```

### Custom Colors

Edit `_config.yml` to match your team colors:

```yaml
theme:
  colors:
    primary: "#007bff"    # Main color (buttons, links)
    secondary: "#F57E25"  # Accent color (highlights)
```

Then edit `assets/css/main.css` and update the color variables at the top.

### Disabling Features

Turn off features you don't need in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
features:
  blog: true           # News/blog section
  docs: true           # Documentation section
  cad_viewer: false    # 3D model viewer (disable if not using)
  circuit_viewer: false
  search: true
```

## Troubleshooting

### "My changes aren't showing up"

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Check if the latest workflow has a green checkmark
3. If there's a red X, click on it to see the error
4. Wait 2-3 minutes after the green checkmark for changes to appear
5. Try a hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### "The site looks broken"

This usually means a YAML syntax error. Check:
- All quotes are matched (`"text"` not `"text`)
- Colons have a space after them (`key: value` not `key:value`)
- Indentation uses spaces, not tabs

### "Images aren't loading"

1. Make sure the file path is correct (case-sensitive!)
2. Check that the image was actually uploaded
3. Paths should start with `/assets/images/`

### "I messed something up!"

Don't panic! GitHub keeps history of all changes:

1. Go to the file you want to restore
2. Click **History**
3. Find a version that worked
4. Click **"..."** → **"Revert changes"**
