## Quick Start

### Option A: Setup Wizard (Recommended)

The wizard is the fastest way to get your site configured. It walks you through every setting — colors, team data, features, navigation — with a live preview. No file editing needed.

**Before you start, have these ready** (~2–3 hours to complete):

| Category | What you need |
|---|---|
| Team Info | Team name, number, program (FTC/FRC/VEX/FLL), current season |
| Brand | Primary and secondary colors (hex codes, or use the color picker) |
| Online | Instagram, GitHub, YouTube, Twitter URLs · contact email |
| People | Each member: name, role, grade, grad year, bio · Each mentor: name, role, org, bio |
| Season | Sponsors (name, tier, URL) · Awards (name, event, season) · Events (name, date, location, type) |

> **Photos and logos** are referenced by file path (e.g. `/assets/images/photo.jpg`). Upload image files to your project separately — fields left blank use a placeholder automatically.

**How to use the wizard:**

1. Fork this repository and enable GitHub Pages (see [Step 1–2 below](#1-fork-this-repository))
2. Visit `/wizard/` on your live site — or it launches automatically on first visit
3. Work through the 11 steps (save progress at any point using the **Save Progress** button)
4. On the final Review step, click **Download pitcrew-config.zip**
5. Extract the zip, copy the files into your local repo, and push to GitHub:

```bash
git add _config.yml _data/
git commit -m "Initial site setup via wizard"
git push
```

**Need to stop partway through?** Click **Save Progress** on any step to download `pitcrew-progress.zip`. Copy those files into your project and commit — your data is preserved. When you return to `/wizard/` later, all saved data is already in place.

---

### Option B: Manual Setup

Prefer editing files directly? Here's the four-step path.

#### 1. Fork this Repository

1. Click **"Fork"** at the top-right of this page
2. Your fork will be at `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pitcrew`

#### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages** in your fork
2. Set **Source** to **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **Save**

#### 3. Edit Your Team Info

Open `_config.yml` (pencil icon on GitHub) and update:

```yaml
title: "Your Team Name Robotics"
description: "Your team's tagline or mission statement"

site:
  team_name: "Your Team Name"
  team_number: "12345"
  program: "FTC"        # FTC | FRC | VEX | FLL
  current_season: "2025-2026"
```

Commit the change.

#### 4. Wait for Deployment

Go to the **Actions** tab — wait for the workflow to show a green checkmark (~2–3 min). Your site is live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/pitcrew`.

See the [Customization Guide](#customization-guide) below to continue filling in your team's data.

---

## Customization Guide

All content lives in two places: `_config.yml` (settings, colors, navigation) and `_data/*.yml` (team, sponsors, events, etc.). Edit either on GitHub directly or use the [Setup Wizard](#option-a-setup-wizard-recommended).

### Changing Your Team Information

Edit `_config.yml`:

```yaml
title: "Thunderbolts Robotics"
description: "Building robots, building futures"

site:
  team_name: "Thunderbolts"
  team_number: "12345"
  program: "FTC"
  current_season: "2025-2026"
  logo: "/assets/images/logo.png"

socials:
  instagram: "https://instagram.com/thunderbolts12345"
  github: "https://github.com/thunderbolts12345"
  youtube: "https://youtube.com/@thunderbolts12345"
  twitter: "https://twitter.com/thunderbolts"
  email: "team@thunderbolts.org"

fundraising:
  enabled: true
  url: "https://gofundme.com/your-campaign"
  text: "Support Our Team"
```

### Adding Team Members

Edit `_data/team.yml`:

```yaml

  bio: "Software developer who loves teaching students about real-world coding practices."
  image: /assets/images/placeholder.svg
  organization: Microsoft
```

### Adding Sponsors

Edit `_data/sponsors.yml`. Tiers: `platinum` · `gold` · `silver` · `bronze`.

```yaml
- name: TechCorp Industries
  tier: platinum
  logo: /assets/images/sponsors/techcorp.png
  url: https://techcorp.example.com

- name: Community Bank
  tier: gold
  logo: /assets/images/sponsors/bank.png

```yaml
- name: Inspire Award
  event: State Championship
  season: 2024-2025
  description: "Highest honor recognizing teams that embody the mission of FIRST."

- name: Think Award
  event: League Championship
  season: 2024-2025
  description: "Excellence in engineering documentation and the design process."
```

### Adding Events

Edit `_data/events.yml`. Types: `competition` · `outreach` · `event`.

```yaml
- name: League Meet 1
  date: 2026-01-18
  location: Lincoln High School
  type: competition
  description: "First qualifying meet of the season."

- name: STEM Night at Elementary School
  date: 2026-01-25
  location: Maple Elementary
  type: outreach
  description: "Robot demonstration for elementary students."
```

### Writing Blog Posts

Create a file in `_posts/` named `YYYY-MM-DD-title-here.md`:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "League Meet 1 Recap: Great Start to the Season!"
date: 2026-01-20
author: Sarah Chen
categories: [competition, recap]
tags: [league-meet, awards]
description: "A summary of our performance at League Meet 1."
image: /assets/images/placeholder.svg
---

We had an amazing time at League Meet 1 this weekend!

## Results

Our robot finished with a 4-1 record in qualifying matches.

## What We Learned

1. Our intake needs faster cycle times
2. Driver practice paid off — much smoother than scrimmages

## Next Steps

- Redesigning the intake rollers
- Adding sensors for automatic alignment
```

### Editing Pages

Each main page is a Markdown file — click it on GitHub, hit the pencil icon, and commit:

| File | Page |
|------|------|
| `index.md` | Home page |
| `about.md` | About Us |
| `sponsors.md` | Sponsors |
| `awards.md` | Awards |
| `contact.md` | Contact |
| `season.md` | Current season overview |
| `news.md` | Blog/news listing |
| `handbook.md` | Team handbook |
| `judge-mode.md` | Judge-friendly summary |

### Adding Photos

Upload images to the appropriate subfolder and reference them by path:

| What | Folder | Used in |
|------|--------|---------|
| Team member photos | `assets/images/team/` | `_data/team.yml` → `image:` |
| Sponsor logos | `assets/images/sponsors/` | `_data/sponsors.yml` → `logo:` |
| Season photos / robot / gallery | `assets/images/seasons/YYYY-YYYY/` | Season front matter → `hero_image:` |
| Site logo | `assets/images/` | `_config.yml` → `site.logo:` |

**Photo tips:** Square crops work best for team photos · landscape (16:9+) works best for hero images · keep files under 500 KB · JPG for photos, PNG for logos.

---

## Updating Your Season Page

Each season has its own file at `_seasons/YYYY-YYYY.md`:

```markdown
---
layout: season
title: "2025-2026 Season"
season: "2025-2026"
game_name: "INTO THE DEEP"
robot_name: "Phoenix"
# hero_image: /assets/images/seasons/2025-2026/robot.jpg  # Optional: replaces hero gradient with a photo
---

## Robot Overview

Phoenix features mecanum wheels, dual-stage linear slides, and a compliant-wheel intake.

## Competition Results

| Event | Date | Rank | Awards |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| League Meet 1 | Jan 18 | 3rd | Think Award |

## Outreach

This season we've reached 400+ students through 6 STEM workshops and 3 library events.
```

To archive last season, leave its file in place at `_seasons/2024-2025.md` — it will appear automatically in the archive.

---

## Advanced Features

### Custom Colors

Edit `_config.yml` — **this is the only file you need to change**. No CSS rebuild required; colors are injected into every page at build time as CSS custom properties.

```yaml
theme:
  colors:
    primary: "#003974"              # Buttons, links, gradients
    primary_highlight: "#002855"    # Hover states, gradient midpoint
    primary_darkest: "#001a3d"      # Hero gradient end stop
    secondary: "#F57E25"            # Accent color (highlights, badges)
    secondary_highlight: "#d96a1f"  # Accent hover states
    success: "#28a745"
    info: "#17a2b8"
    warning: "#f0b37e"
    danger: "#dc3545"
    sponsor_platinum: "#9ca3af"
    sponsor_gold: "#eab308"
    sponsor_silver: "#d1d5db"
    sponsor_bronze: "#92400e"

  dark_mode: true   # true = dark mode on by default
```

All components reference these variables — never hardcoded values — so a single edit propagates everywhere. The [Setup Wizard](#option-a-setup-wizard-recommended) includes a live color preview that shows exactly how your choices look before you download.

### Hero Background Image

The hero banner at the top of every page uses a color gradient by default. You can replace it with a photo — site-wide or per-season.

**Site-wide** — applies to every page unless a season overrides it:

```yaml
# _config.yml
site:
  hero_image: "/assets/images/hero.jpg"
```

**Per-season** — each season can show its own robot photo. Add `hero_image` to the season's front matter:

```yaml
# _seasons/2025-2026.md
---
layout: season
season: "2025-2026"
hero_image: /assets/images/seasons/2025-2026/robot.jpg
---
```

The season-level setting takes priority over the site-wide one. If neither is set, the gradient is shown.

**Photo tips:** Landscape orientation (16:9 or wider) works best · keep files under 1 MB · a dark overlay is applied automatically so white text remains readable. Store season photos in `assets/images/seasons/YYYY-YYYY/`.

---

### Disabling Features

```yaml
features:
  blog: true
  docs: true
  cad_viewer: false           # 3D model viewer
  circuit_viewer: false       # Electrical schematic viewer
  search: true
  alumni_auto_archive: true
  accessibility_toggle: false # Accessibility mode toggle (disabled by default)
```

Disabled features are not built and won't appear in navigation.

### 3D Robot Viewer

1. Export your CAD as GLTF or GLB format
2. Upload to `assets/models/robot.glb`
3. Add to your season page:

```liquid
{% include components/robot-viewer.html
   model_src="/assets/models/robot.glb"
   alt_text="3D model of Phoenix robot"
%}
```

---

## Local Development (Optional)

Preview changes on your computer before publishing.

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Ruby | 3.0+ | Mac: `brew install ruby` · Windows: [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org/) |
| Node.js | 18+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| Git | any | Mac: `brew install git` · Windows: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pitcrew.git
cd pitcrew
bundle install
npm install
npm run build:css
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open `http://localhost:4000`.

### Making and Pushing Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push
```

Your live site updates in 2–3 minutes.

### CSS Rebuild

`npm run build:css` compiles Tailwind into `assets/css/output.css`. **You only need this if you're modifying `main.css` itself** — adding new component classes, changing layout styles, etc.

For color changes, skip it entirely — colors live in `_config.yml` and are injected by Jekyll at build time.

To auto-recompile while editing `main.css`:

```bash
npm run watch:css
```

## Troubleshooting

**Changes aren't showing up**
1. Check the **Actions** tab — look for a green checkmark
2. If there's a red X, click it to see the error
3. After the green checkmark, wait 2–3 minutes, then hard-refresh (`Cmd+Shift+R` / `Ctrl+Shift+R`)

**Site looks broken**
Usually a YAML syntax error. Check:
- All quotes are matched (`"text"` not `"text`)
- Colons have a space after them (`key: value`)
- Indentation uses spaces, not tabs

**Images aren't loading**
- Paths are case-sensitive on Linux hosts
- Confirm the file was uploaded and the path matches exactly (starting with `/assets/images/`)

**Wizard keeps redirecting on startup**
Set `startup_wizard: false` in `_config.yml`, or check **"Skip wizard on startup"** on the wizard's Review step before downloading.

**Something's broken and I want to undo it**
GitHub keeps full history. Go to the file → click **History** → find a working version → **"..." → "Revert changes"**.
